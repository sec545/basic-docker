This project is used for a Docker basics lab in the <a href="https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/cloud-security-architecture-and-operations/">SANS SEC545: Cloud Security Architecture and Operations</a> course.

It creates a tiny Docker image that will function as a web server on port 8080 and serve static web assets copied into the image from the site folder.
